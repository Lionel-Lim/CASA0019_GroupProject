We are creating the digital twin of CE Lab 107. The purpose of the device is to display the indoor environment and room capacity. We will use the four sensors already deployed in the room and will deploy an additional data feed that is recording any people in the lab. We will collect the data feed from MQTT and display it on the physical and digital twin devices.

Aims and Objectives 

1. Replicate the CE107 Lab design and convert to a digital twin (view in Unity) 
This is achieved by using Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) camera to scan the CE107 lab and upload to Unity to display accurate room dimensions. 

2. To display real time data collected from four sensors in CE107 lab. This is achieved by using MQTT data to display the real live data on physical and virtual devices. 

3. To display capacity of the CE107
This is achieved by using of Fixed Point Camera and AI code to detect people in the room and display this data on physical and virtual devices. LED lights to indicate the percentage of the available capacity.

To keep track of our progress we have utilised a project plan. This will allow us to view the deadlines for each step of the project such as project pitch presentation, final presentation and final report submission and all the aspects of design and implementation in-between.
