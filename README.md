1.	Introduction
The aim of this report is to provide detailed information on the TwinLab-CE107 project. This project was initialised in mid-November 2022 and concluded on 16th December 2022.  

UCL East (One Pool Street) opened its doors in Autumn 2022. MSc Connected Environments is taught in CE107 Lab which is based on the first floor. As a newly operated building, it is thought that developing a digital twin of the lab would be beneficial for long-term management. Arup (2019) noted that digital twin can optimise the use of materials, improve user experience and predict component maintenance and replacement.  In addition, the digital twin has the ability to achieve the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals that address rapid urbanisation, population growth and escalating infrastructure costs. One of the aims of this project is to build a digital twin of the CELab and display its parameters within a mobile app.

2.	Literature Review
2.1 Space occupancy and current applications
Occupancy of spaces is currently implemented across a variety of businesses such as shopping centres, shops, gyms, offices and public transport. Transport for London (TFL) has real-time line and station crowding available on tubestatus.net website as well as predictions of the busiest period of the day (TubeStatus.net, 2022).  Medium (2018) has explored seven different sensors that are deployed within spaces to count occupancy. Each sensor has the benefits and challenges of counting accurately or ethically, as noted in Table 1.

The project briefly explored the occupancy detecting technology that is currently on the market and their benefits and challenges. 

Density Open Areas – Uses depth data and machine learning to anonymously count. 

Density Entry – Uses infrared lasers to count people walking in and out of the room/space. 

Break-beam (AIR) – Break beam sensors have an infrared emitter and an infrared receiver. Due to human complex movement, its accuracy is questionable. 

WiFi Tracking – Phone WiFi tries to connect to available WiFi transmitters. Often used in retails and corporate offices. Seen as an invasive and unethical approach and is inaccurate at room level. 

Seat Sensors - Above each seat/underneath each desk a sensor is placed which counts seat specific data. Considered as low cost however battery replacement can be an issue on a large-scale project. 

Thermal Camera – Uses body heat and computer vision via thermal camera to detect human activity. Considered as unreliable accuracy. 

Cameras or Optical Vision Sensors – Smart cameras use second-by-second change in pixel to detect movement and identify people or other objects in a scene, Mostly used in retail building security and corporate offices. Considered inexpensive and provides impressive analytics. Limitations include field of view, privacy issues, ethics and security as camera systems are ideal for hacking.

2.2 Importance of Air Quality
For everyone living in a metropolitan area, the importance of air quality is highly important. Defra (2022) reported that products generated from space heating, power generation and motor vehicle traffic are the major contributing factors to air pollution. Air pollution in Greater London can be detrimental to human health, as noted in Table 2.

Pollutant and Health effects at very high levels
Nitrogen Dioxide, Sulphur Dioxide, Ozone - Irritate the airways of the lungs, increasing the symptoms of those suffering from lung diseases
Particles -	Fine particles can be carried deep into the lungs causing inflammation and worsening of heart and lung diseases
Carbon Monoxide - Prevents uptake of oxygen by the blood – reducing oxygen supply to the heart, particularly those suffering from heart disease

2.3 Noise Impacts 
Ecophon (2022) noted that excess noise within educational facilities will negatively impact learning as well as physical and mental health. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), the safe level of noise in a classroom cannot exceed 35 decibels, and anything above this level will impair the ability to learn.

2.4 Temperature within a room
Automated ventilation/heating/air conditioning within smart buildings has been on the rise, meaning that regulating temperature within the room and/or building is easier (Alawadi et al., 2020). A study in Helsinki University of Technology (2015) showed that performance increases with temperatures up to 21-22 degrees. Any temperatures above or below are stated to hinder the highest productivity.

To keep track of our progress we have utilised a project plan. This will allow us to view the deadlines for each step of the project such as project pitch presentation, final presentation and final report submission and all the aspects of design and implementation in-between.
